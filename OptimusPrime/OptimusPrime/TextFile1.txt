My program works like this:

Declare variables: innum of type String, num of type Unsigned Integer, prime of type Boolean and quit of type Boolean.
Enter main loop (run when quit is false)
	Ask user for input
	Read the input into innum
	Check if innum is "q"
		If yes, set quit to True and skip checking for prime
	Try converting innum into an Unsigned Integer and storing it in num
		If it worked:
			Check if num is prime (Call CheckPrime with num), and inform the user of the result
		If it didn't:
			Inform the user that their input is invalid

CheckPrime is called with argument num:
	Declare variable i of type Integer and set it to 2
	Repeat until i equals num:
		If num is divisible by i and i is not equal to num, return False
		Increase i by 1
	Otherwise, return true
