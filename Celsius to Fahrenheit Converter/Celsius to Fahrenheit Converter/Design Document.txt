To create a program which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit, I will need the following variables:
tempC, of type Integer, to store the Celsius value
tempF, of type Integer, to store the Fahrenheit value

F = 9C / 5 + 32
C = (F-32) * 5/9

Despite the fact that I'm using integers, I am using normal division and Math.Round() because
it produces desired results.

The program will also warn the user whenever they attempt to convert text to a number.

Suggestions:
* Have the program use decimals to increase precision
* Make it available on mobile phones
* Display a thermometer scale with the temperatures
